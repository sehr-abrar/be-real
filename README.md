# Project 3 - **BeReal**

Submitted by: **Sehr Abrar**

**BeReal** is an iOS app that lets users share daily photos with captions and locations, view a feed of posts from other users, and interact through comments in a social media-style experience.  

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total  

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users can launch the app and log in or sign up with a username and email.  
- [x] Users are not able to see other usersâ€™ photos until they upload their own.  
- [x] Users can interact with posts via comments; comments display the commenter's username.  
- [x] Posts include a timestamp and location.  
- [x] Users can upload new photos with optional captions to appear in the feed.  
- [x] Users stay logged in across app launches.

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app included handling image uploads from the photo library, managing dynamic comment bindings without causing compiler crashes, and maintaining a clean UI that resembles BeReal while using only SwiftUI and mock data for a frontend-only version.
